# C-RNN
This is my implementation of [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn). I built the program on top of batchnet.c which is a generic back-propagation neural network implementation in C language found in the book [Neural Network PC Tools0(https://books.google.com/books/about/Neural_Network_PC_Tools.html?id=W0OjBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false)

To run the program, create weights matrices using testweight.c and then run the rnnnet.c file
